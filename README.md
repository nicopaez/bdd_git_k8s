BDD from git to k8s by @inicopaez
=================================

Summary
-------

Behaviour-Driven Development is a key agile technique to ensure the developed software behaves according to user expectations. In this workshop we will start by reviewing BDD concepts and we will see how to develop an application from scratch by applying BDD and other agile techniques like Hexagonal Architecture and Walking Skeleton. We will explore in detail the BDD/TDD/CI cycle and we will see how to integrate it in a Continuous Delivery Pipeline to take our code from the source control system to the cloud. We will use BDD to drive the coding of the application and also the coding of the infrastructure. We will be using tools like Cucumber, GitLab-CI, Docker and Kubernetes among others. This is a hands-on workshop, participants will work on their machines and also using a cloud environment.

Notes for participants
------------------------------

This workshop requires participantes to prepare their machines with the following software:

* Git client
* GitLab (free) account 
* Docker Desktop (docker-engine, docker-compose and kubectl)
* Visual Studio Code
* Zoom.us

During the workshop each participant will decide to work with Ruby (v2.5.7) or Java (8) so the corresponding development tools will be requiered.
